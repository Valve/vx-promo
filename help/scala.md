To run Scala apps issue:

    language: scala

Scala 2.10.3 is used by default.

Because of Scala's versions multitude and incompatibilities it's not preinstalled
in image. Instead, [sbt-extras][extras] is used together with caching.
[sbt-extras][extras] detects and automatically installs the required version sbt which,
in turn, manages the version of the language. Everything is being installed and set up
during the first run, then works fast because of caching.


Testing is run with these commands:

    sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION update
    sbt ++$SCALA_VERSION test

Scala and Java versions can be managed:

    scala:
      - 2.10.2
      - 2.10.3

    jdk:
      - openjdk7
      - oraclejdk7

JDKs preinstalled in image include

* openjdk7
* oraclejdk7
* oraclejdk8

Java 6 isn't included.

Caching is turned on automatically when you use Scala. To turn it off set:

    cache: false
